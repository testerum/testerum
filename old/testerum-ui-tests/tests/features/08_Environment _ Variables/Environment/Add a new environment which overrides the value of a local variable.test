    description = <<
        First we will create a global variable in Default environment FIRST_DEFINED_VAR which has the value "true".
        Second we create a new environment called Production which overrides the FIRST_DEFINED_VAR with the value "false".
        
        We execute the test and should see that we have failed test at the end.
