StepCall should have a status
    - if a subStep is Undefined a parent step Call should have a status that reflects this state
    - A ComponsedStep without no child steps should have a special STATUS

How do we show to the user is about to edit an and existing Step Call and he will brake some other tests

Creating ComposedStep in the test screen
    - What is the path of this step, how the user can set a path
        - As a default this path can be the test path. User can change the location of this step later on the Steps screen
    - if the ComposedStep has parameters, how can the user set the type of this params
    - how a user can edit a new added step
