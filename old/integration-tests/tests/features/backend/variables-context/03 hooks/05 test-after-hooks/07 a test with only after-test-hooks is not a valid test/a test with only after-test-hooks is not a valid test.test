test-def: a test with only after-test-hooks is not a valid test

    test-properties = <<manual>>

    description = <<
        This test allows us to check that a tests is marked UNDEFINED if it doesn't have steps, even if it has hooks.
        
        Because this will make the entire test fail, we mark this test as manual.
        To check, un-mark as manual, run the test, and then mark manual again.
    >>

    after-hook: Then <<true>> is true
