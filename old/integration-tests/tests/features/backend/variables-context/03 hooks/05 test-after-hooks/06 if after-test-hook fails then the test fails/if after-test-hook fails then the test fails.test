test-def: if after-test-hook fails then the test fails

    test-properties = <<manual>>

    description = <<
        This test allows us to check that the test fails if an after-hook fails (even if the steps were successful).
        
        Because this will make the entire test fail, we mark this test as manual.
        To check, un-mark as manual, run the test, and then mark manual again.

    step: Then <<true>> is true

    after-hook: Then <<false>> is true
